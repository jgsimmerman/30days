I think I've figured out how to embed YouTube videos to my posts, following [this awesome post](https://adam.garrett-harris.com/how-to-easily-embed-youtube-videos-in-jekyll-sites-without-a-plugin) from Adam Garrett-Harris. This was a bit out of necessity, because my big occomplishment for the day was watching this Transcendent CSS talk on YouTube.

I think that video changed the way that I think about CSS, and now I feel like I *have* to go finish reading [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Transcending-CSS-Fine-Art-Design/dp/0321410971).  

Aside from that, I've been struggling with my CSS Zen Garden all afternoon, trying to get things positioned properly. I'm going to keep practicing and I'll check out the [learnlayout.com](http://learnlayout.com/) site for further assistance.
